# Caching

## What is Caching?

Caching is the process of storing copies of data or files temporarily in a fast-access storage layer, known as a cache, so that future requests for that data can be served more quickly. It is a fundamental technique used to improve the performance and scalability of systems by reducing access latency and decreasing the load on underlying resources.

## How Does Caching Work?

- When data is requested for the first time, it is fetched from the original source (like a database or remote server).
- This data is then stored (cached) in a faster storage layer (memory, disk, or CDN).
- Subsequent requests for the same data are served directly from the cache, which is much quicker than fetching from the original source.
- Cached data is often associated with an expiration time (TTL - Time To Live), after which it is refreshed or removed.

## Types of Caching

| Type                 | Description                                                  | Typical Use Cases                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Browser Caching**  | Stores web resources (HTML, CSS, images) locally on the client | Speeds up webpage loading on repeat visits    |
| **Server-side Caching** | Data or pages cached in memory/disk on a web server             | Reduces database hits for dynamic content     |
| **Database Caching** | Caching query results or objects in memory (Redis, Memcached) | Improves database query performance            |
| **CDN Caching**      | Content cached on edge servers geographically distributed      | Delivers static assets quickly to global users|

## Benefits of Caching

- **Faster Response Times:** Data served from cache is accessed much quicker.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Decreases the number of expensive operations like database queries.
- **Improved Scalability:** Supports higher traffic volumes without degrading performance.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces bandwidth usage and database compute costs.

## Example: HTTP Caching with Cache-Control Headers

```http
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public
```

- Tells browsers and intermediate caches to store the resource for 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- Helps avoid redundant requests for unchanged resources.

## Caching Challenges

- **Cache Invalidation:** Ensuring cached data stays fresh and consistent with the source.
- **Cache Stampede:** Many clients requesting data simultaneously missing the cache and overloading the backend.
- **Storage Limits:** Cache size is limited and eviction policies must be handled efficiently.

## Summary

Caching is a critical performance optimization technique used throughout computing. By storing frequently requested data in faster storage layers and strategically managing cache lifecycles, systems can deliver data faster, reduce backend load, and scale more effectively.
